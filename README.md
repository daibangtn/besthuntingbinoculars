Are you <a href="http://huntingbinocularsguide.com/">hunting for a binocular</a>? Originally, all binoculars and spotting scopes have their origin in classical telescopes in their basic design and technicality. The mechanism of lens and objective lens are similar. While a spotting scope resembles a mini telescope, a binocular can be considered as an optic instrument with two telescopes. Both produce an image which has the depth of field that we are used to, rather than just a large flat image. The light is refracted as it passes through the lens by the time the viewer sees the image, which is upside down. In order to correct this, two prisms are placed within the binocular, between the eyepiece and objective lens. Some of the well known brands for binoculars are Nikon, Swarovski, Vortex, etc. Depending on your purpose the brands and magnification of the binoculars will vary.
